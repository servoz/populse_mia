This module is useful whenever you need to be sure that a function (more
exactly anything that can be called by python) is executed in a particular
thread.

For exemple, if you use PyMat (which is an interface between Python and a Matlab,
see U{http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~steriana/Python} for more information)
it is necessary that all calls to pymat.eval are done by the same thread that
called pymat.open. If you want to use PyMat in a multi-threaded application,
you will have to build appropriate calling mechanism as the one proposed in
this module.

The main idea is to use a list containing functions to be called with their
parameters. A single thread is used to get entries from the list and execute
the corresponding functions. Any thread can put a call request on the list
either asynchonously (the requesting thread continues to run without waiting
for the call to be done) or synchronously (the requesting thread is stopped
until the call is done and the result available).

class SingleThreadCalls:

    '''
    Allows the registration of functions that are going to be called from a single
    thread. This single thread must continuously call L{processFunctions}.
    Registration can be blocking (see L{call}) or non blocking (see L{push}).
    Blocking registration wait for the function to be processed and returns its
    result (or raises its exception). Non blocking registration put the function
    in the list and return immediately, ignoring any return value or exception.

    Example::
      stc = SingleThreadCall()
      processingThread = threading.Thread( target=stc.processingLoop )
      stc.setProcessingThread( processingThread )
      processingThread.start()
