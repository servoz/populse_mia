class BufferAndFile(object):

    '''
    This class is a read only file-like object that allows to read ahead and
    push data back into the stream. All pushed back data are stored in a buffer
    that is "read" by all subsequent read acces until it is empty. When the
    buffer is empty, reading is done directly on the attached file object.

    Example::

      from soma.bufferandfile import BufferAndFile

      # Open a file with a buffer
      f = BufferAndFile.open( fileName )
      # Check that the file content is XML
      start = f.read( 5 )
      # Put back the read characters
      f.unread( start )
      if start == '<?xml':
        # Use the file in an XML parser
        ...
      elif start == '&HDF':
        # Use the file in an HDF5 parser
        ...
